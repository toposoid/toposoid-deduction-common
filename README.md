In particular, this module is used by units that perform deductive reasoning in Toposoid projects.

[![Unit Test Action](https://github.com/toposoid/toposoid-deduction-common/actions/workflows/action.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/toposoid/toposoid-deduction-common/actions/workflows/action.yml)

## Requirements
* Scala version 2.13.x,
* Sbt version 1.9.0
* The following microservices must be running
  * toposoid/toposoid-sentence-parser-japanese-web
  * toposoid/toposoid-common-nlp-japanese-web
  * toposoid/toposoid-sentence-parser-english-web

sbt publishLocal
```
## Usage
```scala
//Defines convenient functions to access and extract information from Neo4j data during inference
import com.ideal.linked.toposoid.deduction.common.FacadeForAccessNeo4J._
//Defines convenient functions to access and extract information from Weaviate data during inference
import com.ideal.linked.toposoid.deduction.common.FacadeForAccessVectorDB._
//Define convenience functions for parsed data of propositions during inference
import com.ideal.linked.toposoid.deduction.common.AnalyzedSentenceObjectUtils._
//Definition of LocalNode's Duduction parent class
import com.ideal.linked.toposoid.deduction.common.DeductionUnitController
